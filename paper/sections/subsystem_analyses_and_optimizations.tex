With the system model integrated, subsystems must be analyzed prior to conducting top-level trade studies.
Multiple subsystems are under-constrained and require more information than is provided by the user to operate.
Prior to running trade studies, optimizations are performed 
in order to select values for any of the unknown inputs.
The methodology used to perform these optimizations is discussed in detail in this section.
Furthermore, analysis of individual subsystems can provide critical insight into system level behavior.
The variations in energy consumption, structural costs, and capacity scaling
can be initially observed through these subsystem analyses,
then more fully developed through system level analyses.
Subsystem analyses that provide critical insight to system level behavior are
discussed in this section as they begin to illustrate major conclusions.
