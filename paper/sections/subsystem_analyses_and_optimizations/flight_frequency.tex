The traffic between the notional end points and the market demand for tickets
at a given cost will determine the amount of passengers the Hyperloop must be
able to accommodate in a given period of time. The number of passengers per
unit of time that the Hyperloop can transport is equal to the number of
passengers per pod times the frequency at which pods depart. If a constant pod
capacity is assumed, then the only way to accommodate periods of high
demand is to increase the frequency at which pods depart. It is important to
understand the limitations of pod frequency in order to obtain a reasonable
sense of maximum passenger throughput. There are three factors that must be
considered when evaluating limitations on pod frequency: safety, the amount of
time it takes to board, and the number of pods available. Pods must be spaced
out such that each pod can slow down and stop before hitting the pod in front
of it in the event of an emergency stop. Linear acceleration equations can be
used to determine the minimum distance separation diatance to allow for deceleration.
This analysis determined that pods would need 30 seconds to decelerate at 1 g
to avoid collision, which corresponds to a maximum pod frequency of
roughly 2 pods per minute. These calculations can be found in the source code referenced
in the Appendix. This frequency should easily be satisfied, even
with a safety margin, due to the time that must be allowed for passengers to
board. It is likely that passengers will need considerably more than 30
seconds to board, meaning that safety will most likely not be the limiting factor on
maximum pod frequency. Finally, in this analysis, it is assumed that the
operator must have enough pods to fill the entire tube when launching flights
at a given frequency. Consequently, having less time in between pods reduces
the distance in between pods, which increases the number of pods required to
fill the tube and sustain the desired pod frequency. Due to these three
limiting factors, lower pod frequencies are desirable because they increase
the safety margin in the event of emergency braking, increase the time
passengers have to board, and reduce the number of pods that the operator must
have in order to sustain a given pod frequency. The impact of changes in pod
capacity on system design and performance will be discussed in further detail
later in this study.
