The full-system model of the Hyperloop can be decomposed into two main
sub-systems: the passenger pod and tube. At the top level, analyses were
performed integrating the pod and tube systems with a ticket cost  and sample
mission modules. Below is a tree view of the system.
The appendix includes an XDSM diagram key which describes how to interpret
the following diagrams for the pod, tube, and mission subsystems.

Further sub-systems were broken down within the pod and tube components and are detailed below.
