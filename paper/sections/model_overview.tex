Hyperloop System Model Overview

The Hyperloop full-system model is decomposed into two main subsystems-the passenger pod and tube. At the top level, analyses was performed integrating the pod and tube systems with a ticket cost module and sample mission module. Tree diagrams for the passenger pod and tube systems can seen below:

Further sub-systems were broken down within the pod and tube components, and are detailed below. Full documentation can be found in the following sections of the Appendix:
